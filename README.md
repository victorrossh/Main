## Integration with Mainmenu

The **Main** plugin was developed to integrate with another plugin called **mainmenu**, which is in the same repository. The **mainmenu.sma** allows players to interact with other server plugins in a centralized way.

### Available Natives

The **main.sma** exposes the following natives for integration with **mainmenu.sma**:

- **native_spawn_player(id)**: Respawn the player at the saved position.
- **native_save_player(id)**: Reset the player's saved position.
- **native_open_save_menu(id)**: Open the save menu for the player.

These natives are used by **mainmenu** to provide additional functionalities to players.

## Help Plugin (Commands and Assistance)

In the same repository, there is a plugin called **help.sma**, which displays an HTML page (MOTD) with the list of commands available on the server. This plugin can be accessed directly through **mainmenu** (case 8) or via the following commands:

- **/comandos**: Opens the help page with the list of commands.
- **/help**: Also opens the help page.
